# Oasis InfoByte Internship â€“ OIBSIP

# 1.	Iris Flower Classification

The Classification of Iris Flower is one of the examples of basic Machine learning.
Objective:The aim of this project is to classify among the three species. They are Setosa, Virginica, Versicolor. They are classified based on the four fields provided in the dataset.

About the Dataset: It contains totally 150 instances, 50 of each species. The fields available are SepalWidth, SepalLength, PetalLength, PetalWidth and the species name.

EDA: The data is analyzed and studied further to know how they are aligned and made them ready for applying the machine learning algorithm.
Machine Learning Model: The below mentioned algorithm are applied and got to know the accuracy of each model. Please find the below accuracy and model specified.

The train and test split are done in 80:20 ratio for classification.

# 2.	Unemployment Analysis with Python

Objective: Unemployment is calculated as the ratio of number of people unemployed to the total number of people in the labor force rate. This is the one of the basic examples of analysis and visualization project in data science. 

About the Dataset: Had 9 fields and 267 records of the data, which has information like Region, Area, Date, etc. These are some fields that can be used for analysis.

EDA: Analyzed the dataset for duplicate values, null values, and dropped the irrelevant field from the data. 

Various analysis is done and added description accordingly in the python file.

# 3.	Email Spam Detection:

Objective: To detect the mail to be spam/ham, the main requirement is removing the stop words and split the data into train and test, and then by comparing with the test set, it can be detected as spam/ham.

About the Dataset: Has two important features: class as spam/ham and the message in the email.

EDA: The data is analyzed for it duplicate values, null values and removed those stop words, and applied logistics regression for this type of NLP.

Finally, Classification report has been executed.
